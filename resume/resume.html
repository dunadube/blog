    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
    I am a software developer and architect currently heading the software architecture team at a leading German online dating site in <strong>Munich</strong>. I have been developing software professionally for almost 20 years now. However I am still learning and looking for better ways to develop software.
    I am interested in all kinds of software development methodologies (lean and agile), architecture and design practices and programming paradigms. I consider myself a software development practitioner and believe that good leaders in software development should be hands-on (at least from time to time) in order to lead by example. In my opinion software development is more an art than a science and a software developer should constantly strive to improve his craft.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am especially familiar with the <strong>JAVA</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong> ecosystem, but I am also fascinated by Clojure, Erlang or Smalltalk. 
    Currently I am trying to improve my <strong>Javascript</strong> (browser/node.js), <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> skills as well as diving into scalable machine learning algorithms using mahout.
    </p>
    <p>
    My greatest satisfaction is developing successful software products, i. e. software loved by their users. Be it consumer applications or backend services. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As a leader I find pleasure in making others great (especially if they become better than me).
    </p>
    <p>
    If I had a motto it could be this one:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
      Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction. <cite>&#8212;Albert Einstein</cite>
      </p>
