<p>I finally decided to create a blog and collect my thoughts in it. Why am I doing this NOW while I have been a professional software developer for almost 20 years and never seriously thought about blogging?</p>

<p>Honestly: I am not sure about the reasons. I hope it might be a way to clarify my thoughts or refer to my own views at a later point. Guess it won&#8217;t hurt to get into the habit of regularly writing down stuff. Hope I will be disciplined enough to at least occasionally write something hopefully not too stupid.</p>

<p>What do I want to write about? Well, for the near future I hope to write about: * My progress in learning Clojure and ClojureScript * Experiments with statistics and Clojure * and the occassional piece about architecture and/or design patterns.</p>
