title: My first blog entry (finally) 
---

I finally decided to create a blog and collect my thoughts in it. Why am I doing this **NOW** while I have been a professional software developer for almost 20 years and never seriously thought about blogging?

Honestly: I am not sure about the reasons. I hope it might be a way to clarify my thoughts or refer to my own views at a later point. Guess it won't hurt to get into the habit of regularly writing down stuff. Hope I will be disciplined enough to at least occasionally write something hopefully not too stupid.

What do I want to write about? Well, for the near future I hope to write about:
  * My progress in learning Clojure and ClojureScript
  * Experiments with statistics and Clojure
  * and the occassional piece about architecture and/or design patterns.
